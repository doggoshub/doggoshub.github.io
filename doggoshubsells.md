# What I Sell:

*First of all i sell Scripts and also GUIs.*

My highest price is: 1400 R$ (4.90$)
If i gather enough Robux/ Money you won't need to buy the Scripts/ GUIs.

I don't calcuate the Robux on how good the Script/ GUI should be, instead i set prices that won't change.
1400 R$ (4.90$) is the price of a Script + A GUI (both: 700 R$).

#### Privacy

I made this List:

- I won't save the Scripts you wanted and share them with others
- Any names or personal information you've given will not be saved or screenshotted
- I won't ask you any personal questions
- You are able to tell the Team everything and even rough times you've been/ going trough currently

#### Support Tickets

You are able to create a Ticket if a following reason is occuring to you:

- Going trough rough times
- Your Script doesn't work
- Rude persons in the Chat
- Wanting to become a member of the Team

Please don't open a Ticket if no reason occurs to your problem.
(You can create one if it has something to do with a reason)

# Discord Server

Since i'm trying to grow a bit, i made a Discord Server where you can buy Scripts.
One of the reasons Doggos Hub is a good Script Trader, is that you'll get a response in 24 Hours and you will get your Script in 12 - 24 Hours + If it takes
more than 24 Hours you will get a small amount of Robux: 600 R$ (2.10$) + The Scripts you get from Doggos Hub are pretty much unoutsmartable (I'm not kidding).

Here's Our Discord Server: [Doggos Hub](https://dsc.gg/doggos-hub)
